# Keyx

Elixir library for Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) algorithm. Under the hood it's a simple wrapper around SpinResearch's [RustySecrets](https://github.com/SpinResearch/RustySecrets) using the helpful [Rustler](https://github.com/hansihe/rustler).

Documentation can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/keyx](https://hexdocs.pm/keyx).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `keyx` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:keyx, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
